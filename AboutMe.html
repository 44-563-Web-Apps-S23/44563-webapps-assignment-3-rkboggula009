<body>    
    <p>My name is Rama Krishna Reddy Boggula.I am Born and brought up in Tiruvuru, Andhra Pradesh.
        I used to roam around my place and other nearby places ever since i was a kid to know much 
        about the places.I was basically an introvert, so it was obvious that i used to talk less with 
        other people.But everything changed when i joined college in chennai for undergraduation.
        This college being far from my home town helped me in improving my communication skills while 
        staying away from my parents. I gained confidence talking to my friends while staying among them.</p>
